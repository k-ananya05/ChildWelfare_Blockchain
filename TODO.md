# Phase 2 Implementation - Transaction Lifecycle & Consensus

## Current Status: Backend Infrastructure Complete

### ✅ Completed Tasks
- [x] Phase 1 setup and analysis completed
- [x] Implementation plan created and approved
- [x] Create Node.js backend server with Express
- [x] Implement transaction mempool system
- [x] Add transaction validation logic
- [x] Set up P2P networking with WebSocket fallback
- [x] Implement gossip protocol for transaction broadcasting
- [x] Create consensus mechanism with round-robin leader selection
- [x] Implement block formation with Merkle tree
- [x] Add block validation and state management

### 🔧 Enhanced Smart Contracts (Person A - Block Structure)
- [ ] Extend ChildWelfare.sol with transaction and block structures
- [ ] Add Merkle tree functionality for transaction roots
- [ ] Implement block validation and state management
- [ ] Add consensus-related functions

### ⚖️ Consensus Mechanism (Person A & B - Collaborative)
- [ ] Implement round-robin leader selection (NGO → Government → Hospital → Auditor → Admin)
- [ ] Add failure handling and auto-reselection logic
- [ ] Create consensus validation functions
- [ ] Integrate smart contract execution for state updates

### 📦 Block Formation & Propagation (Person A & B)
- [ ] Implement block construction with headers and bodies
- [ ] Add block signature validation
- [ ] Create block propagation mechanism
- [ ] Handle ledger updates across nodes

### 🧪 Testing & Integration
- [ ] Unit testing of transaction validation
- [ ] Integration testing of consensus mechanism
- [ ] Performance testing of P2P network
- [ ] End-to-end testing of block formation and propagation

## Next Steps
1. Start with backend infrastructure setup
2. Create transaction mempool system
3. Implement P2P networking with libp2p
4. Enhance smart contracts with block structures
5. Implement consensus mechanism
